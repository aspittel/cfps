# Web Development for Data Scientists

## Abstract

A lot of data science work can be improved, be made simpler, or be better explained using web development. In this workshop, we will introduce setting up a web app in Flask, ingest data into the app, and then visualize that data. We will also look at examples of web apps aiding data science work.

## Talk Description

Attendees will walk through building a data visualization application using PostgreSQL in Flask. They will start with configuration and then move to rendering views and adding a data visualization. We will start with basic Python knowledge and add to that in order to build a full application. Throughout, we will use the 538 candy ranking data set. 

### Objectives

* Learn how web development can assist and complement web development work.
* Create an app using Flask
* Connect your Flask app to a PostgreSQL database
* Visualize Data using Dimple.js
* View other examples of data science apps
