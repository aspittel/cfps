# Web Ready Augmented Reality in 47 Lines of Code

## Abstract

Augmented reality is becoming more popular for both its artistic and business applications. This talk will explore the frameworks and tools that make AR more developer friendly, including adding live masks to a webcam image in 47 lines of JavaScript!

## Talk Description

Augmented Reality (AR) is becoming an important field for programmers, and it has really interesting artistic and business implications. I wanted to research how I could implement it within my standard workflow. The first project I thought of was duplicating SnapChat's facial filters. I found several JavaScript libraries for facial recognition in JavaScript, and I decided to build a project with tracking.js because of its documentation and examples.

In this talk, I will take attendees through the development process with tracking.js and through other examples of AR in web development as a whole.

### Objectives

* Discuss the evolving focus on AR and how developers can use it on the web
* Examine different augmented reality web frameworks
* Discuss the technologies behind facial recognition and other augmented reality tools/
* Look at an implementation of a facial recognition application in JavaScript

### Timing

* 3 minute intro 
* 15 minutes demo
* 10 minutes discussion of what AR is
* 15 minutes walking through code
* Remaining time on where to learn more + Q&A
