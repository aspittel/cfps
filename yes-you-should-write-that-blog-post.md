You've probably benefitted from a lot of other developers' blog posts. There are so many reasons why you should write your own, such as: you have a unique perspective to share, your post will help other developers, you will learn from the process, and you can help establish yourself as an expert on the topic.

Writing technical blog posts can be intimidating at first -- it's difficult to come up with a topic to write about, let alone creating the content. We will go over the whole blog post process, from finding a topic through pressing the post button!
