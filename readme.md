# CFP Directory!

I decided to organize most of my conference talks and host them here rather than having to find them in different places whenever I want to submit one!

* [Learning CSS Through Creating Art](./css-art.md)
* [Facial Recognition in JavaScript](./facial-recognition.md)
* [Web Development for Data Science](./web-dev-for-datasci.md)
* [Programming 001](./programming-001.md)
## Not currently submitting, but could be delivered
* [Intro to Frameworks](./intro-frameworks.md)
* [Web Ready Data Visualizations in Python with Bokeh](https://github.com/aspittel/ga-bokeh-lecture)
* [Intro to React](https://github.com/aspittel/ga-react-tutorial)

And the [bio](./bio.md) I'm currently using!
