Ali teaches people how to code at General Assembly. Before that, she was a software engineer working on data science web apps. She loves Python, JavaScript, and talking about code. She is most interested in the intersection of code, art, and social justice.

When Ali's not working, you can find her watching New England sports, competing on CodeWars, taking runs around Capitol Hill, rock climbing, or participating in DC coding community events.

Ali's current personal project is a blog called "The Zen of Programming" where she learns talks about code and her life surrounding it.
