# Programming 001

## Abstract

Programming is becoming more and more prevalent in a variety of fields and in everyday life. In this talk, we will start from the beginning and discuss what a programming language is, how we use one to program, and then we will write our first set of programs.

## Talk Description

Programming is telling the computer how to ingest, process, and then store that data. When someone writes a program, that person is giving the computer a set of commands that it must follow. We will discuss how people write programs and how computers, in turn, understand them. 

Everyday, we see programs in use on websites, cell phones, coffee machines, self-driving cars, Facebook, Amazon, metro card reloaders, supermarket scanners, and most TVs use code to run in addition to your desktop or laptop computer. We will start to look at how these machines use these programs to run.

We then will look at a completed program of a common game and translate its code to more human language. Attendees will then write their first program using CodePen!
