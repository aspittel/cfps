## Summary

React breaks a lot of the best practices we teach new coders -- like separation of concerns and only using JavaScript when completely necessary. The component architecture, unidirectional data flow, and immutable state can also throw new developers off. So, how can you teach React in a comprehensive and understandable way?

Ali has taught hundreds of people React in-person at a coding bootcamp, and her React tutorial has had over sixty thousand online readers. She will discuss the best ways to explain the component architecture, explain the use case for React, and how to engage students. 


## Description

This talk will discuss how to best teach React to new programmers -- this is important in order to relate and communicate well to new teammates or people in the community. 

We will start by talking about who should teach (hint everyone) and then talk about ways to teach including informal mentorship through blogging through in-person teaching.

Then we will discuss the strategies that best work for teaching React, like having people draw out components on websites they regularly use, how to think about state vs. props, what example applications are the most engaging and the best demonstration of React, and how to slowly introduce the concepts instead of overloading students immediately.
