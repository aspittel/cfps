# Writing Workshop: Blogging to Grow Your Open Source Project

## One-sentence description of your presentation 

You've got the code part down, but now there's a problem. How do you get people interested in your project and attract contributors? Or, you have contributors, but how can you express the vision and intent of your project and community? Documentation and blog posts! We'll workshop a content strategy for your open source project from general audience targetting through an outline of a blog post.

## Abstract

Your writing is the most effective way to communicate why and how people should use your project. But, you're a software engineer, not a content strategist! How can you effectively target the people you need to with your blog posts and documentation? Also, how can you accurately communicate the goals for your project?
