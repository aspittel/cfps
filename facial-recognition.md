# Facial Recognition in JavaScript

## Abstract

Augmented Reality is becoming more prevalent in applications. It has both artistic and business applications. This presentation will discuss creating a simple web-ready AR app using JavaScript. 

## Talk Description

Augmented Reality (AR) is becoming an important field for programmers, and it has really interesting artistic and business implications. I wanted to research how I could implement it within my standard workflow. The first project I thought of was duplicating SnapChat's facial filters. I found several JavaScript libraries for facial recognition in JavaScript, and I decided to build a project with tracking.js because of its documentation and examples.

In this talk, I will take attendees through the development process with tracking.js and through other examples of AR in web development as a whole.

### Objectives

* Discuss the evolving focus on AR and how developers can use it on the web.
* Examine different facial recognition libraries in JavaScript.
