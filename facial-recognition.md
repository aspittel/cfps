# Facial Recognition in JavaScript

## Abstract

Augmented reality is becoming more popular for both its artistic and business applications. This talk will explore the frameworks and tools that make AR more developer friendly, including adding live masks to a webcam image in 47 lines of JavaScript!

## Talk Description

Augmented Reality (AR) is becoming an important field for programmers, and it has really interesting artistic and business implications. I wanted to research how I could implement it within my standard workflow. The first project I thought of was duplicating SnapChat's facial filters. I found several JavaScript libraries for facial recognition in JavaScript, and I decided to build a project with tracking.js because of its documentation and examples.

In this talk, I will take attendees through the development process with tracking.js and through other examples of AR in web development as a whole.
