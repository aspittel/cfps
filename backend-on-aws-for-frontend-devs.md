# Backend Development on AWS for Frontend Engineers

Learning some backend principles can help frontend developers further their careers: firstly in order to communicate with backend developers, secondly so that they can build frontend apps. In this workshop, we’ll discuss data modeling, types of databases, distributed systems, and serverless functions. We’ll use AWS Amplify throughout the workshop and discuss the underlying services. You’ll walk away from this workshop with understanding of:
- How to model data
- How to create an application backend and deploy it on AWS
- How to create an AWS Lambda function and deploy it
